This package used to integrate with the new Zoho V3 Api CRM

## Requirements

* PHP >= 8.0
* Laravel >= 8.0

## Registering a Zoho Client

Since Zoho CRM APIs are authenticated with OAuth2 standards, you must register your client app with Zoho. Follow these steps to register your app:

1. Visit the [Zoho API Console](https://api-console.zoho.com/).
2. Click on `ADD CLIENT`.
3. Choose a `Self Client`.
4. Create a grant token by providing the necessary **scopes**, time duration (the duration for which the generated token is valid), and a Scope Description. 
   - For detailed information about available scopes, refer to the [Zoho CRM Scopes Documentation](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v3/scopes.html).
5. Your client app will now be created and displayed.
6. Select the created OAuth client.

### Examnple Scope Configuration

To enable all required settings and operations for Zoho CRM, use the following scope:

```
ZohoCRM.users.ALL,ZohoCRM.org.ALL,ZohoCRM.settings.ALL,ZohoCRM.modules.ALL,ZohoCRM.bulk.ALL,ZohoCRM.notifications.READ,ZohoCRM.notifications.CREATE,ZohoCRM.notifications.UPDATE,ZohoCRM.notifications.DELETE,ZohoCRM.coql.READ
```

**Warning:** 
Using such comprehensive scopes grants extensive permissions to the client. Ensure this is only done for trusted and secure applications. Review your application's use cases and adhere to the principle of least privilege to mitigate potential risks.


## Installation

You can install the package via `composer require`:

```bash
composer require asciisd/zoho-v3
```
After installing the package you can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="zoho-v3-config"
```

after that you need to create the OAuth client and get the credentials from Zoho by run the following command:

```bash
php artisan zoho:install
```

You'll need to add the following variables to your .env file. Use the credentials previously obtained registering your
application.

```dotenv
ZOHO_AUTH_FLOW_TYPE=grantToken
ZOHO_CLIENT_ID="Code from Client Secrit Section"
ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET="Code from Client Secrit Section"
ZOHO_REDIRECT_URI="${APP_URL}/zoho/oauth2callback"
ZOHO_CURRENT_USER_EMAIL=admin@example.com
ZOHO_TOKEN="Code Generated from last step"

# available datacenters (USDataCenter, EUDataCenter, INDataCenter, CNDataCenter, AUDataCenter)
ZOHO_DATACENTER=USDataCenter
ZOHO_SANDBOX=true
```

After that you need to run the following command to add token and refresh token to your storage

```bash
php artisan zoho:grant
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="zoho-v3-config"
```

You can publish and run the migrations with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="zoho-v3-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

### Environments
maybe in some cases you wish to enforce zoho to use one of zoho's environments, so you can go to `AppServiceProvider`
and use `Zoho::useEnvironment()` method

```php
Zoho::useEnvironment(EUDataCenter::DEVELOPER());
```

So that will override config settings.

## Usage

Imagine that you need to get all modules from Zoho system.

```php
use Asciisd\Zoho\ZohoManager;

$response = ZohoManager::make(self::TESTING_MODULE);
$modules  = $response->getAllModules();
```

## Model Can be used like this:-

Available only starting from **v1.1.0**

add `Zohoable` as extended class like this:-

```php
use Asciisd\Zoho\Zohoable;
use Asciisd\Zoho\ZohoManager;

class Invoice extends Zohoable {
    
    // this is your Zoho module API Name
    protected $zoho_module_name = 'Payments';

    public function searchCriteria(){
        // you should return string of criteria that you want to find current record in crm with.
        //EX:
        return ZohoManager::make('Payments')
                            ->where('PaymentID', $this->payment_id)
                            ->andWhere('Order_ID', $this->order_id)
                            ->getCriteria();
    }

    public function zohoMandatoryFields() {
        // you should return array of mandatory fields to create module from this model
        // EX:
        return ['Base_Currency' => $this->currency];
    }
}
```

so now you can use invoice like this

```php
$invoice = \App\Invoice::find(1);

// to check if has zoho id stored on local database or not
$invoice->hasZohoId();

// to return the stored zoho id
$invoice->zohoId();

// that will search on zoho with provided criteria to find the record and associated your model with returned id if exist
// if you provided an `id` that will be used instead of searching on Zoho
$invoice->createOrUpdateZohoId($id = null);

// you can also send current model to zoho
// that wil use `zohoMandatoryFields` method to Serialize model to zohoObject
// Also you can pass additional fields as array to this method
$invoice->createAsZohoable($options = []);
```

**Note:** To use the Invoice like this, you must have the `invoices` table in your database just like you would for any
Laravel model. This allows you to save data to the database and also be able to link it to the `zohos` table and use all
the functions in `Zohoable`. Use the CRUD functions below if you do not intend to use the Zohoable model this way.

## CRUD Can be used like this:-

#### READ

```php
use Asciisd\Zoho\ZohoManager;

// we can now deal with leads module
$leads = ZohoManager::useModule('Leads');

// OR

$leads = ZohoManager::make('Leads');

// find record by its ID
$lead = $leads->getRecord('3582074000002383003');
```

#### UPDATE

```php
$record = new Record();
$record->setId('3582074000002383003');

// Set value as field
$record->addFieldValue(Leads::FirstName(), 'Updated');
$record->addFieldValue(Leads::LastName(), 'Record');

// Set value as key value
$lead->setKeyValue('Phone', '5555555555552');

// Then call update() method
$response = $leads->update($record);
```

#### CREATE

```php
// create the record into zoho crm then get the created instance data
$response = $leads->create([
    'First_Name' => 'Amr',
    'Last_Name' => 'Emad',
    'Email' => 'test@asciisd.com',
    'Phone' => '012345678910',
]);

```

#### DELETE

```php
// delete record by its id
$lead = $leads->delete('3582074000002383003');

```

#### SEARCH

##### Word

```php
use Asciisd\Zoho\ZohoManager;

$records = ZohoManager::useModule('Leads')->searchRecordsByWord('word to be searched');
$first_record = $records[0];
```

##### Phone

```php
use Asciisd\Zoho\ZohoManager;

$records = ZohoManager::useModule('Leads')->searchRecordsByPhone('12345678910');
$first_record = $records[0];
```

##### Email

```php
use Asciisd\Zoho\ZohoManager;

$records = ZohoManager::make('Leads')->searchRecordsByEmail('nobody@asciisd.com');
$first_record = $records[0];
```

##### Criteria

```php
use Asciisd\Zoho\ZohoManager;

$records = ZohoManager::make('Leads')->searchRecordsByCriteria('(City:equals:NY) and (State:equals:Alden)')->get();
$first_record = $records[0];
```

##### Custom

```php
use Asciisd\Zoho\ZohoManager;

$records = ZohoManager::make('Leads')
                    ->where('City', 'NY')
                    ->andWhere('State','Alden')
                    ->get();

$first_record = $records[0];
```
